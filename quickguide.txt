1. Run the AddressBookApplication file.
2. Now we will add an AddressBook using postman and the following request url and json body. (feel free to use another tool ex. CURL, intellij)
     POST
     http://localhost:8080/addressbook
     {
         "bookName":"Address Book A"
     }

     // The bookName variable just gives the book a String name. It has no other specific meaning

3. Now we can add a buddy to this addressbook using the following request url and body

    POST
    http://localhost:8080/addressbook/1/BuddyInfo
    {
    	"firstName": "Mable",
        "address": "21 Kell street",
        "phoneNumber": "1233455678"
    }

4. Add as many addressbooks and buddies as you like. After you can view them using the following GET requests
    GET
    http://localhost:8080/addressbooks      //endpoint using spring boot rest repositories. Provides information with links to individual nested fields
    http://localhost:8080/addressbook       // custom endpoint to return json body with nested list as a json object (easier to see whats in the structure)

5. View the addressbook GUI using thymeleaf templating by going to the following url in a web browser
    http://localhost:8080/addressbook/{addressbook_id}      // Replace the addressbook_id field with the id of an addressbook you created

6. Delete a buddy from the addressbook using the following request
    DELETE
    http://localhost:8080/addressBook/{addressbook_id}/BuddyInfo/{buddyinfo_id}
